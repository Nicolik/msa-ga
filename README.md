# Multi Sequence Alignment with Genetic Algorithms

This project is a fork of the repo [msa-ga](https://github.com/filipefalcaos/msa-ga) from [filipefalcaos](https://github.com/filipefalcaos).

The original repo was written in Python, whereas here there is also a MATLAB implementation. The MATLAB implementation requires **[MATLAB Bioinformatics Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/bioinfo.html)**.
